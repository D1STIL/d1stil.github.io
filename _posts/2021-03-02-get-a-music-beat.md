Whether it is a soothing tune or a catchy jingle, the fabulous entertaining rhythms and beats --- the magic we call 'music' --- is surely a core entity for our heart and soul. Feeding off the ears, we find a soundtrack for every mood, including 'study time'.

But is the joyous act of listening to our favorite pop stars and vocalists on the white list? Are all songs and music beneficial for our concentrations' health?

Like the discovery of fire by mankind, music poses both a form of energizing entertainment as well as a cloaking distraction.

THE POSITIVE EFFECTS
====================

Does music help us study? Well, for a major proportion of our student-life population, they do agree --- big smiles and honest nods applied.

In fact, having the headphones lick our ears with their wonderful breath (the music) make some of us feel more 'alive'. It allows them to open their eyes and feel their spirits raked out by the touch of Alan Walker, Marshmello, Bruno Mars, Charlie Puth, Bebe Rexha, etc.

If you are trying to concentrate on solving a critical math problem --- for example --- and your environment is a fiery storm of chaotic disturbances and noxious noise, all it takes to drown out the alienated atmosphere is a gentle, yearned-after remedy of some white noise or ambience.

One die-hard fanatic of AMN has left a testimonial, that : "An easy method to get away from it all is to switch on my iPod and run 'Lunarium', 'Sparkling Water', and 'Shade of Dusk'. Truly punches my stressed-up heart and makes my study0time a funky, chilled-out experience!"

Another teenager has a strong opinion that having a musical shower each day grants him an opportunity to freshen up, especially with House Noir's 'Living Tomorrow'; he is never demotivated and recalls the tunes during stress attacks.

So, no matter how horrible, disruptive, and dystopia-struck an event or situation is, a sip of music from your favorite family of albums and artists can draw a vignette around yourself with ease. They say that if you can ride into battle with your nation's anthem in mind, the chances of victory are boosted tenfold; like a mirror, the momentum of exams are similarly easier to tackle if you have the beloved voices and instruments running in your head --- the catalyst.

WHAT THE RESEARCHERS SAY
========================

Although researchers have proposed the theory that mental attributes such as attention spans, spatial memory, and analytic abilities are triggered better via listening to music, the opinions of the experts vary.

Instead of augmenting your skills and sharpening your brain, some scientists have proven that listening to music causes an equivalent magnitude of devastation.

Research by ICEferno International suggests that music consumption can lead to distractions, lack of focus, or even deafness (in the case of excess exposure to extremely violent or loud audio).

A team of prestigious psychologists have discovered that some music contains age-inappropriate uncensored lyrics that explicitly introduce the reference to violent acts, crime, drugs, or even suicide. A recent survey has retrieved a lead that listening to 'Worked on the Bass', a demonic electro-dubstep track, has led to hysteria and lack of self-control.

Roses may seem aesthetic a sight, but look closer and you shall find the lethal thorns. So do you think music is more of a blessing? Or a curse?

WHAT TYPES OF MUSIC ARE MOST BENEFICIAL
=======================================

As mentioned above, it all depends on the taste of the listener, whichever genre of music should be optimum for your mind.

It is a natural instinct to reap benefits from those tracks with which we are most familiar or comfortable with, e.g. Mahir Beats' 'Zone' from his *Mystic* album. And those are the types of music which would suit you best.

If you are more of a 'general-purpose' fan, then it is best to choose music that has a repetitive beat, that contains little or no vocals at all, and that provides a calm tone or peaceful relief when you taste it through your ears. ('Eyes' and 'Warm', by Mahir Beats are among my personal favorites.)

All in all, whether music helps you to study is not a monotonous fact and it varies greatly from person to person --- just like our hobbies. All that matters is that your studying is at the summit!

Happy listening!
